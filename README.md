# Recommendationsystem
Amazon Recommendation system 
Task is to build a recommendatry system using Machine Learning and deep learning .
We have recommend similar products for a particular product to the user for their better experience
We used tokenization, stemming and removal of stopwords from Product tilte and product description and then we used word2vec to extract
features from text.
We also used VGG16 to get bottleneck features from Images of products.
we find euclidean distance between feature vactors to get cosine similarity.
